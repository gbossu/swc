# SWC (Sliding Window Container)
SWC is a window-embedder (and probably much more in the near future). Its job is to embed windows in a Qt container, so that the window can be slided in and out of the screen in a fancy manner.


## Using swc
Syntax is as follow:
```
# Create a new container with a chosen swc-id
swc <input option> [options] <swc-id>

# Toggle an existing container (slide in or out)
swc <swc-id>
```

### Input options
You can either use an existing window as input, or create a new process
- window-id of an existing window (```-w <WID>```)
- pid of an existing process (```-p <PID>```)
- class-name of an existing window (```-c <className>```) 
- class of an existing window (```--class <class>```) 
- window name of an existing window (```-n <windowName>```)
- create a process from a binary file. A classname can be given to help the window lookup. (```-b "<binaryFile> [parameters]" [-c <className>]```)

### Other options
- position (```-P x,y```)
- size (```-S {width,height | auto}```)
- interrupt/pause the process when the container is hidden (```-I```)
- sliding direction (```-D u|d|r|l```)


## Configuration file
More options can be adjusted in the configuration file located in *$HOME/.config/swc/swc.conf*. This file is auto-generated by swc and it will contain the default values for all the settings currently supported by this version of swc.

Below are the settings that you can change (or soon can).

### Container placement
- position_type and position
- size_type and size
- anchor
- immovable

### Container decorations
- curved corners
- transparency
- blur

### Container properties
- releaseOnExit
- pauseOnHide
- className
- neverClose

### Animation properties
- direction
- duration
- easing
- displayTime

### Window Hints
- skipWindowManager
- alwaysOnTop


## TODO
- Better compilation process
- Create installation rules
- Create commented version of default settings file
- Implement all the options
- Better error management
- Add example execution
